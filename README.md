# 🧹 Data Cleaning Projects

## 📌 Project Description

**Data cleaning** is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt, inaccurate, incomplete, or duplicated records from a dataset. Clean data is crucial for building reliable data-driven models and making sound business decisions.

This repository showcases various **data cleaning projects** that demonstrate essential data preprocessing techniques commonly used in real-world data analysis tasks.
